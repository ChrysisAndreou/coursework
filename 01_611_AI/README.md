# Seven Six Puzzle AI

This project implements a "Seven Six Puzzle" game (similar to Connect Four) where a human player can compete against an AI. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, with an option to employ Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimization, to determine the best possible move. The project also includes an experiment to compare the performance of the Minimax algorithm with and without Alpha-Beta Pruning.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play a game of Seven Six Puzzle against a computer AI.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make intelligent decisions.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Option to enable Alpha-Beta Pruning to significantly speed up the AI's decision-making process.
- **Performance Analysis**: An experiment mode to visualize and compare the move calculation times of the AI with and without Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- **Customizable AI Depth**: Users can set the depth of the Minimax algorithm to adjust the AI's difficulty.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Matplotlib

You can install the necessary library using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib```

### How to Play

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/seven-six-puzzle-ai.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd seven-six-puzzle-ai
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python code.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to:
   - Enter the desired depth for the Minimax algorithm (1-6).
   - Choose whether to use Alpha-Beta Pruning (y/n).
   - Enter the column number (1-6) for your move when prompted.

## The Game

The game is played on a 7x6 grid. You are Player 'O' and the computer is Player 'X'. The computer always plays first. The first player to get four of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

## AI and Algorithm

The AI's logic is built upon the **Minimax algorithm**, a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games. It explores the possible future moves to a certain depth and chooses the move that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances.

**Alpha-Beta Pruning** is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm. It reduces the number of nodes that are evaluated in the search tree by "pruning" branches that will not influence the final decision. This results in a much faster AI without affecting the quality of its moves.

## Performance Visualization

The `experiment_game()` function in the code runs a simulated game between two AI players: one using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning (MAX player) and the other without (MIN player). It then generates a plot comparing the time taken for each move, demonstrating the efficiency gained by using Alpha-Beta Pruning.

Below is an example of the performance comparison graph generated by the experiment:

## Code Overview

- `play_game()`: The main function to start and manage the interactive game between a human and the AI.
- `experiment_game()`: Runs a simulation to compare the performance of Minimax with and without Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- `minimax()`: Implements the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- `minimax_no_pruning()`: Implements the standard Minimax algorithm.
- `score_position()`: Evaluates the board and assigns a score based on the arrangement of pieces.
- `winning_move()`: Checks if a player has won the game.
- Helper functions for board creation, printing, and move validation.
